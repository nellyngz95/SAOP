# SAOP
This repository consists in the feature extraction script and the bottleneck framework used for the Synthetic Audio Optimization (SAOP) by feature importance.
You will find the :
* Feature extraction script.
  We used the 6KSFX Dataset combined with samples of online sound effects libraries
* BottleNeck Framework with XGBoost.
  In the folder BottleNeckProcess, you will find the script and the csv of the extracted features, plus the csv of the top 5 most important features.
